    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm Jim. I'm a cofounder of <a href="https://logicmag.io">Logic Magazine</a>. I co-wrote a strange book with lots of red text in it. So far it's been <a href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/The-Lifespan-of-a-Fact/">published</a> in <a href="http://www.hanser-literaturverlage.de/buch/das-kurze-leben-der-fakten/978-3-446-24138-1/">three</a> <a href="http://www.vies-paralleles.org/portfolio/que_faire_de_ce_corps_qui_tombe/">languages</a>. I am currently the CTO at <a href="https://amino.com/">Amino</a>, whose mission is to create the clearest picture of the American healthcare system and connect everyone with the best care possible.</p>
    <p>I enjoy programming, <a href="#projects">particularly on weird creative projects</a>.</p>
    <p>My <a href="http://chartsock.com">partner</a> and I have adopted <a href="img/doggies.jpg">retired racing greyhounds</a>, and currently have a cute little Staffy mix named Piglet.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    Selected works.
    <h3>52 Bots</h3>
    <img src="img/hwaet.jpg">
    <p>Originally this was a project to create a twitter bot each week, then it just turned into making a bunch of bots. Done primarily in Python, with all source online. My favorite one so far, <a target="_blank" href='https://twitter.com/HwaetBot'>@HwaetBot</a>, uses a Markov model to auto-generate Old English riddles, trained using the Exeter Book as source material.</p>
    <p>The full listing of the bots can be found on <a href="http://52bots.tumblr.com/">our Tumblr page</a>.</p>
    <h3>Skynetheremin</h3>
    <img src="img/theremin.png">
    <p>The Skynetheremin is a distributed theremin that is powered by a Leap Motion controller, a user-interface device that tracks the user's hand motions. It was written in javascript using node.js, web audio, and a whole lotta libraries.</p>
    <p>To view the app, using Chrome (or maybe Firefox, anything else at your own risk) go to: <a href="http://skynetheremin.herokuapp.com/">http://skynetheremin.herokuapp.com/</a>.</p>
    <p>Click and drag on the screen to make your own music.</p>
